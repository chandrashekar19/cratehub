 # üöÄ Crate ‚Äì Development Setup Guide

This project contains both the **backend API** (Node.js + Express + GraphQL + Sequelize) and the **frontend web app** (React + Redux).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Development Setup

### 1. Run Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start


2. Run Frontend

Copy code
cd frontend
npm run dev
Then open the web app at üëâ http://localhost:3000/

‚ö° Multi-Package Automation
Once Node.js, Docker (for MySQL), and your configuration are set up correctly, you can manage both packages easily.
